# BenAI Obsidian Plugin — Assistant

## Pre-flight Check

1. Check if `./claude.md` or `./CLAUDE.md` exists in the current working directory
2. If missing: tell the user "This vault hasn't been set up yet. Run `/setup` to bootstrap your vault." — then stop
3. If present: continue

## Mode Detection

Read the `claude.md` file and check for `os-mode` in the frontmatter or first few lines:

- `os-mode: business` → Business mode
- `os-mode: personal` → Personal mode
- `os-mode: general` or not specified → General mode (default)

The detected mode affects routing, file paths, review templates, and available features throughout this skill.

## Routing

Match the user's intent to the right section:

| User says... | Go to |
|---|---|
| "resume", "start session", "pick up where I left off" | [Resume Session](#resume-session) |
| "save", "compress", "end session", "wrap up session" | [Compress / Save Session](#compress--save-session) |
| "remember this", "preserve", "save permanently" | [Preserve Knowledge](#preserve-knowledge) |
| "morning", "evening", "daily review", "weekly review" | [Daily Review](#daily-review) |
| "task", "to-do", "create task", "check tasks" | [Task Management](#task-management) |
| "output style", "writing style", "switch style" | [Output Styles](#output-styles) |
| "save this prompt", "swipe file", "framework", "template", "resources" | [Resources](#resources) |
| "meeting", "transcript", "action items", "Fireflies", "sync meetings" | [Meeting Intelligence](#meeting-intelligence) |

If unclear, show this table and ask what they need.

## Vault Interaction

### Obsidian CLI (Preferred)

When Obsidian is running, use the CLI for vault operations — it triggers Obsidian events and keeps the UI in sync:

```bash
obsidian read file="Note Name"              # Read a note
obsidian create name="Note" content="..."   # Create a note
obsidian append file="Note" content="..."   # Append to a note
obsidian daily:read                         # Read today's daily note
obsidian daily:append content="..."         # Append to daily note
obsidian search query="term" limit=10       # Search vault
obsidian tasks                              # List tasks
obsidian property:set file="Note" key="status" value="done"
```

Check if available: `which obsidian`. If unavailable, fall back to direct file read/write.

For full CLI reference, read `references/obsidian-cli.md`.

### Obsidian Flavored Markdown

All vault notes MUST use OFM syntax. Key rules:

- **Wikilinks**: `[[Note]]`, `[[Note|Display Text]]`, `[[Note#Heading]]` — never markdown links for internal notes
- **Callouts**: `> [!type] Title` — use for visual structure (tip, warning, important, question, todo, success)
- **Embeds**: `![[Note]]`, `![[image.png|300]]`
- **Highlights**: `==text==`
- **Comments**: `%%hidden%%`

For full reference, read `references/obsidian-formatting.md`.

## Resume Session

Reconstruct full context so the user picks up where they left off.

### Steps

1. **Load core memory** — Read the primary context file and project READMEs:
   - General: `Context/me.md`, glob `Projects/*/README.md`, scan `Context/strategy.md` if it exists
   - Business: `Context/operator.md`, `Context/organization.md`, glob `Projects/*/README.md`, glob `Departments/*/README.md`, scan `Context/strategy.md`
   - Personal: `Context/me.md`, glob `Projects/*/README.md`, scan `Context/goals.md` if it exists
   Prefer `obsidian read` if CLI is available; otherwise read files directly.
2. **Load recent daily notes** — Default: last 3 from `Daily/` (sorted by filename date). With a number arg: last N notes. With a keyword arg: last 3 + `obsidian search query="keyword"` across all daily notes. Read Quick Reference sections first (low token cost); dig deeper only if needed.
3. **Check active tasks** — Try in order:
   - `obsidian tasks` (if CLI available)
   - TaskNotes API: `curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tasks?status=open"`
   - Skip if neither available
4. **Check goals/strategy** — Mode-specific:
   - General/Business: If `Context/strategy.md` has content, scan for active goals and approaching milestones
   - Personal: If `Context/goals.md` has content, scan for current focus and habits
5. **Present briefing** — Concise standup format:
   ```
   Welcome back, [name].

   **Last session** (date): [Brief summary — link [[projects]] mentioned]
   **In Progress**: [[Project-A]] — [task], [[Project-B]] — [task]
   **Pending**: [[Project-Name]] — [items left over]
   **Upcoming**: [[Project-Name]] — [deadlines, milestones]

   What would you like to focus on today?
   ```
   Business mode: also include department status and OKR progress if available.
   Personal mode: also include life area status and habit streak if available.
6. **Update daily note** — Create/append to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with a "Current Session" section. Prefer `obsidian daily:append` if CLI available.

### Guidelines
- Keep the briefing short — like a quick standup, not a data dump
- Prioritize actionable items: overdue tasks, deadlines this week, unfinished work
- If memory files are empty (new vault): "This is your first session. What would you like to work on?"
- Use the user's name from the primary context file if available

---

## Compress / Save Session

Save everything valuable from the current session so future sessions can pick up seamlessly.

### Steps

1. **Save everything** — Don't ask what to preserve. Automatically save all learnings, decisions, solutions, files modified, pending tasks, and errors.
2. **Create session log** — Append to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (prefer `obsidian daily:append` if CLI available):
   ```markdown
   ## Session Log: HH:MM — [Topic Summary]

   ### Quick Reference
   **Topics:** [comma-separated — use [[wikilinks]] for projects and people]
   **Projects:** [[Project-Name]], [[Project-Name]]
   **Outcome:** [what was accomplished]
   **Duration:** [approximate]

   > [!important] Decisions Made
   > - [[Project-Name]] — [Decision — reasoning]

   > [!tip] Key Learnings
   > - [Learning — link [[related notes]] when applicable]

   > [!info] Solutions & Fixes
   > - [[Project-Name]] — [Problem -> Solution]

   ### Files Modified
   - [file path — what changed]

   > [!todo] Pending Tasks
   > - [ ] [[Project-Name]] — [Task]

   ### Raw Session Summary
   [Condensed summary — use [[wikilinks]] for every project, person, and vault note mentioned]
   ```
   Only include YAML frontmatter if creating a new file. Keep Quick Reference to 5-6 lines max (it's designed for fast AI scanning on resume). **Every project, person, and vault note reference MUST use `[[wikilinks]]`** — this is what builds the graph.
3. **Update memory files** — Route to mode-appropriate files:
   - General: User preferences → `Context/me.md`, project updates → `Projects/{name}/`, strategy changes → `Context/strategy.md`
   - Business: Operator preferences → `Context/operator.md`, org updates → `Context/organization.md`, department updates → `Departments/{name}/`, process updates → `Intelligence/processes/`
   - Personal: Preferences → `Context/me.md`, goal updates → `Context/goals.md`, area updates → `Areas/{area}.md`, collection items → `Collections/{type}.md`
   - All modes: Skill-specific content (references, strategy, style prefs) → `Skills/{skill-name}/`
   - All modes: Pending tasks → create via TaskNotes API
4. **Auto-archive** — If the primary context file exceeds 100 lines, archive older entries. Never archive core identity or active preferences.
   - General/Personal: `Context/me.md` → `Intelligence/archive/me-archive-YYYY-MM.md`
   - Business: `Context/operator.md` → `Intelligence/archive/operator-archive-YYYY-MM.md`
5. **Report** — Tell the user what was saved and where. "You're safe to close. I'll remember everything next time."

### Guidelines
- If the session was short/trivial, create a minimal log (Quick Reference only)
- Be thorough with the Raw Session Summary — future sessions depend on it

---

## Preserve Knowledge

Save durable knowledge that persists indefinitely (unlike compress, which saves session context).

### Steps

1. **Save immediately** — Don't ask what to remember. When the user shares something worth preserving, just save it to the right file.
2. **Route to the right file** — there is no catch-all. Everything has a home. Routing depends on mode:

**General mode routing:**

| Type | File |
|------|------|
| User preferences, style, habits | `Context/me.md` |
| Project info | Route to the right file in `Projects/{name}/` (see [Project Intelligence](#project-intelligence)) |
| Business insight | `Context/business.md` |
| Strategy and goals | `Context/strategy.md` |
| Competitive insight | `Intelligence/competitors/{name}.md` |
| Market insight | `Intelligence/market/{topic}.md` |
| Decision with reasoning | `Intelligence/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md` |
| Reusable content (prompts, frameworks, templates) | `Resources/` |
| Skill-specific content (references, strategy for a skill) | `Skills/{skill-name}/` |
| Rules for assistant behavior | Root `claude.md` (Rules section) |

**Business mode routing:**

| Type | File |
|------|------|
| Operator preferences, work style | `Context/operator.md` |
| Org structure, company info | `Context/organization.md` |
| Team member info | `Context/team.md` |
| Strategy, OKRs, goals | `Context/strategy.md` |
| Brand, voice, tone | `Context/brand.md` |
| Vendor/partner/investor info | `Context/stakeholders.md` |
| Department info, charter, KPIs | `Departments/{name}/README.md` |
| Department SOP | `Departments/{name}/sops/{name}.md` |
| Org-wide process/runbook | `Intelligence/processes/{name}.md` |
| Project info | Route to the right file in `Projects/{name}/` (see [Project Intelligence](#project-intelligence)) |
| Competitive insight | `Intelligence/competitors/{name}.md` |
| Market insight | `Intelligence/market/{topic}.md` |
| Decision with reasoning | `Intelligence/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md` |
| Onboarding docs | `Onboarding/{name}.md` |
| Reusable content | `Resources/` |
| Org document templates | `Resources/templates/` |
| Skill-specific content (references, strategy for a skill) | `Skills/{skill-name}/` |
| Rules for assistant behavior | Root `claude.md` (Rules section) |

**Personal mode routing:**

| Type | File |
|------|------|
| Preferences, personality, habits, values | `Context/me.md` |
| Goals, intentions, milestones | `Context/goals.md` |
| People info (family, friends, contacts) | `Context/people.md` |
| Project info | Route to the right file in `Projects/{name}/` (see [Project Intelligence](#project-intelligence)) |
| Life area update (health, finance, etc.) | `Areas/{area}.md` |
| Book, article, course, media | `Collections/{type}.md` |
| Decision with reasoning | `Intelligence/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-{title}.md` |
| Reusable content | `Resources/` |
| Skill-specific content (references, strategy for a skill) | `Skills/{skill-name}/` |
| Rules for assistant behavior | Root `claude.md` (Rules section) |

3. **Auto-archive check** — If the primary context file exceeds 100 lines, archive older entries. Never archive core identity or active preferences.
4. **Report** — After saving, tell the user what was saved and where.

### Teaching Loop

When the user corrects you, automatically add a rule to `claude.md` under the Rules section. Don't ask — just do it and confirm what was added.

### Guidelines
- Check for duplicates before adding
- Be precise about file paths in reports
- If info doesn't clearly fit a category, pick the closest match — don't create a new dumping ground

---

## Daily Review

Morning check-in, evening reflection, and weekly review routines. Templates differ by mode.

### Routing

1. Check time: before noon → suggest morning; after 5pm → suggest evening
2. If user explicitly requests a type, use that
3. If unclear, ask

### Template Selection by Mode

| Review | General | Business | Personal |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| Morning | `references/template-morning.md` | `references/template-morning-business.md` | `references/template-morning-personal.md` |
| Evening | `references/template-evening.md` | `references/template-evening.md` | `references/template-evening-personal.md` |
| Weekly | `references/template-weekly.md` | `references/template-weekly-business.md` | `references/template-weekly-personal.md` |

Read the appropriate template before generating the review.

### Morning Routine

1. Read most recent daily note from `Daily/`
2. Query TaskNotes for open/in-progress tasks (note overdue items)
3. Check `Projects/` for approaching deadlines
4. Mode-specific additions:
   - Business: Check `Departments/` for department status, upcoming meetings
   - Personal: Check `Areas/` for habit tracking, `Context/goals.md` for current focus
5. Ask mode-appropriate questions:
   - General: mood/energy (1-10), main focus, blockers
   - Business: main focus, key meetings, blockers
   - Personal: mood/energy (1-10), gratitude, intention, main focus
6. Save to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD Morning.md` with appropriate frontmatter
7. Create 1-3 tasks in TaskNotes based on energy and deadlines. Report what was created.

### Evening Routine

1. Read today's morning note
2. Compare task progress vs morning intentions
3. Ask mode-appropriate questions:
   - General: accomplishments, one thing learned, top priority for tomorrow
   - Business: accomplishments, decisions made, top priority for tomorrow
   - Personal: wins, one thing learned, habit check, gratitude, top priority for tomorrow
4. Save to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD Evening.md` with appropriate frontmatter
5. Mark completed tasks as done via API; route any new insights to the right file (see [Preserve Knowledge](#preserve-knowledge))

### Weekly Review

1. Read all daily notes for the current week
2. Scan `Projects/` for movement
3. Query TaskNotes for done tasks — celebrate wins
4. Mode-specific checks:
   - General: Check `Context/strategy.md` — flag goals with no active project
   - Business: Check OKR progress, department health, pipeline/revenue metrics
   - Personal: Check life-area balance, habit streaks, goal progress
5. Ask mode-appropriate questions:
   - General: biggest win, what to do differently, focus for next week
   - Business: biggest win, OKR progress, blockers, focus for next week
   - Personal: biggest win, what to do differently, gratitude, focus for next week
6. Save to `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD Weekly Review.md` with appropriate frontmatter
7. Plan top 3 priorities for next week; create tasks in TaskNotes automatically
8. Archive completed items if appropriate

### Guidelines
- Be conversational, not robotic — this is a check-in
- If TaskNotes API is unavailable, continue without task data
- After every review: update tasks, update daily note, route insights to the right files

---

## Task Management

Two interfaces available for task management. Try in order:

### 1. Obsidian CLI (Preferred)

```bash
obsidian tasks                               # List all tasks
obsidian daily:append content="- [ ] Task"   # Quick task in daily note
```

### 2. TaskNotes HTTP API (Full CRUD)

TaskNotes runs as an Obsidian plugin with an HTTP API on `localhost:8080`. Tasks are stored as markdown files in `TaskNotes/Tasks/`.

```bash
curl -s --max-time 2 "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tasks" > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "API running" || echo "API not available"
```

If neither is available: "Task system isn't responding. Make sure Obsidian is open." Do NOT fall back to file-based task creation.

### API Reference

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`

| Operation | Method | Endpoint | Body |
|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| List all | GET | `/tasks` | — |
| List by status | GET | `/tasks?status=open` | — |
| Create | POST | `/tasks` | `{"title", "status", "priority", "due", "scheduled", "projects", "contexts", "tags"}` |
| Update | PUT | `/tasks/Tasks/task-name.md` | `{"status": "in-progress"}` |
| Complete | PUT | `/tasks/Tasks/task-name.md` | `{"status": "done"}` |
| Delete | DELETE | `/tasks/Tasks/task-name.md` | — |
| Options | GET | `/options` | — |

### Task Properties

- **Statuses**: `open` (default), `in-progress`, `done`
- **Priorities**: `none`, `low`, `normal` (default), `high`
- **Optional fields**: `due` (YYYY-MM-DD), `scheduled` (YYYY-MM-DD), `projects` (array), `contexts` (array), `tags` (array), `timeEstimate` (minutes), `blockedBy` (array of task paths)

### Guidelines
- Always check API availability before operations
- Minimum fields for creation: `title` and `status`
- Add `due` dates when user mentions a deadline
- Add `projects` when clearly related to a known project
- Present task lists as clean markdown tables
- For bulk deletes, confirm with user first. All other operations proceed automatically.

---

## Output Styles

Output styles define how the assistant communicates. Styles are bundled as reference files within this skill (`references/style-*.md`). Users can override or add custom styles in `.claude/output-styles/`.

### Available Styles

**All modes:**

| Style | Reference File | Use When |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Conversation | `references/style-conversation.md` | Default — chat, brainstorming, Q&A |
| YouTube Script | `references/style-youtube-script.md` | Video scripts |
| Blog Post | `references/style-blog-post.md` | Long-form articles |
| Quick Reply | `references/style-quick-reply.md` | DMs, short messages |
| Email | `references/style-email.md` | Professional emails |
| Meeting Summary | `references/style-meeting-summary.md` | Meeting transcripts |

**Business mode only:**

| Style | Reference File | Use When |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| SOP | `references/style-sop.md` | Standard operating procedures |
| Report | `references/style-report.md` | Business reports for stakeholders |

### Loading a Style

1. **Check vault first**: If `.claude/output-styles/{style-name}.md` exists in the vault, use that (user override)
2. **Fall back to reference**: Otherwise, read `references/style-{style-name}.md` from this skill's references
3. **Default**: Always use `conversation` style unless told otherwise

### Switching

- **Explicit**: "write a YouTube script" → load `youtube-script` style
- **Context clues**: Working on meeting transcript → auto-switch to `meeting-summary`
- **"Go back to normal"** → revert to `conversation`

### Creating Custom Styles

1. Ask about content type, tone, format, and rules
2. Create at `.claude/output-styles/[style-name].md` with sections: Identity, Tone, Format, Rules, Examples
3. Test with a sample, iterate until the user is happy

### Personalization

User voice from the primary context file is applied ON TOP of the active style. Style files define structure; preferences define personality. If `Context/brand.md` exists (General/Business modes), also apply brand guidelines.

### Guidelines
- Always read the style file before producing styled output — don't rely on memory
- Check `.claude/output-styles/` first for user overrides, then fall back to bundled references

---

## Resources

`Resources/` is the user's personal library — swipe files, prompts, frameworks, templates, and reference material.

### Saving Resources

When the user shares reusable content (a great prompt, a framework, a template, reference material):
1. Save to `Resources/` with a descriptive filename
2. Use light nesting if a category is obvious (e.g., `Resources/prompts/`, `Resources/frameworks/`, `Resources/swipe/`)
3. Business mode: org document templates go to `Resources/templates/`
4. Add `tags:` in frontmatter so resources surface in Bases queries
5. Report what was saved and where

### Finding Resources

When the user asks for a saved prompt, framework, or template:
1. List files in `Resources/`: `ls Resources/`
2. Search by keyword: `grep -rl "keyword" Resources/`
3. Read and present the matching resource

### Guidelines
- Keep resources standalone — each file should be useful on its own
- Don't overthink organization — flat with good filenames beats elaborate hierarchy
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to reference resources from project notes or daily notes

---

## Project Intelligence

Projects are not flat README-only folders. They are living, structured directories that grow as information accumulates. The assistant manages project structure intelligently.

### Routing Project Info

When the user mentions something about a project, analyze what it is and route it to the right place:

| Content type | Route to |
|---|---|
| Status update, overview change, deadline | `Projects/{name}/README.md` |
| Research finding, competitor analysis | `Projects/{name}/research/{topic}.md` |
| Spec, requirement, brief | `Projects/{name}/specs/{name}.md` |
| Draft, script, written content | `Projects/{name}/drafts/{name}.md` |
| Idea, brainstorm | `Projects/{name}/ideas/{name}.md` |
| Working notes, scratchpad | `Projects/{name}/notes/{name}.md` |
| Feedback, review comments | `Projects/{name}/feedback/{name}.md` |
| Meeting notes specific to project | `Projects/{name}/meetings/{date}-{topic}.md` |

Note: In **personal mode**, skip `specs/` and `feedback/` — use research, drafts, ideas, notes only.

### Creating Subdirs on the Fly

Don't pre-create empty directories. When content arrives that needs a subdir:

1. Check if the subdir exists
2. If not, create it (`mkdir -p Projects/{name}/research/`)
3. Write the file
4. Update `README.md` to reference the new content if appropriate

### Keeping README as the Index

The `README.md` is the entry point — a project overview with links to deeper content. When subdirectories grow:

- Add a brief reference or link in the README (e.g., "See `research/` for competitor analysis")
- Don't duplicate subdir content in the README
- Keep README focused: overview, status, next steps, key resources

### Reading Project Context

When loading a project's context (during resume or when the user mentions a project):

1. Always read `Projects/{name}/README.md` first
2. List subdirectories to understand scope: `ls Projects/{name}/`
3. Only read subdir files when relevant to the current conversation
4. Use `grep` to scan across project files when searching for specific info

### Project Lifecycle

- **New project**: Starts as just a `README.md`
- **Growing project**: Subdirs appear as content types emerge
- **Completed project**: Move entire folder to `Intelligence/archive/{name}/`
- **Status changes**: Update `README.md` frontmatter (`status: on-hold`, `status: completed`)

---

## Web Content Extraction

When the user shares a URL for context (articles, docs, reference material):

```bash
defuddle parse <url> --md
```

Defuddle strips clutter and returns clean markdown — much more token-efficient than raw web fetching. If `defuddle` is not installed, fall back to standard web fetch.

## Meeting Intelligence

Process meeting transcripts, extract decisions and action items, sync from Fireflies, and file meeting notes in the right folder.

USE WHEN the user:
- Pastes a meeting transcript or drops a transcript file
- Asks to summarize a meeting or extract action items
- Asks about past meetings or meeting patterns
- Mentions Fireflies, asks to sync or pull transcripts
- Shares a URL to a recorded meeting or transcript

### Step 1: Identify Meeting Type

Ask or infer from context. Available types depend on mode:

**General mode:**

| Meeting Type | Save to | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Team standup | `Intelligence/meetings/team-standups/` | What each person did, doing today, blockers. Keep brief. |
| Client call | `Intelligence/meetings/client-calls/` | Client requests, decisions, next steps. Check folder for history. |
| One-on-one | `Intelligence/meetings/one-on-ones/` | Development, feedback, goals. More personal tone. |
| General | `Intelligence/meetings/general/` | Full meeting summary structure. |
| Custom type | `Intelligence/meetings/[custom-folder]/` | As appropriate. |

**Business mode:**

| Meeting Type | Save to | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Team standup | `Intelligence/meetings/team-standups/` | What each person did, doing today, blockers. Keep brief. |
| Client call | `Intelligence/meetings/client-calls/` | Client requests, decisions, next steps. Check folder for history. |
| One-on-one | `Intelligence/meetings/one-on-ones/` | Development, feedback, goals. More personal tone. |
| Board review | `Intelligence/meetings/board-reviews/` | Board decisions, investor updates, governance. Formal tone. |
| All-hands | `Intelligence/meetings/all-hands/` | Company-wide announcements, Q&A, culture. Summarize key messages. |
| Cross-team | `Intelligence/meetings/cross-team/` | Cross-department coordination, dependencies, shared priorities. |
| General | `Intelligence/meetings/general/` | Full meeting summary structure. |
| Custom type | `Intelligence/meetings/[custom-folder]/` | As appropriate. |

**Personal mode:**

| Meeting Type | Save to | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| General | `Intelligence/meetings/general/` | Full meeting summary structure. |
| Personal | `Intelligence/meetings/personal/` | Coffee chats, advisor calls, doctor visits, personal meetings. Casual tone. |
| Custom type | `Intelligence/meetings/[custom-folder]/` | As appropriate. |

### Step 2: Load Output Style

Read `.claude/output-styles/meeting-summary.md` and follow its format exactly. If the file doesn't exist, use the template at `references/template-meeting-note.md`. Read the template before creating any meeting note.

### Step 3: Extract from Transcript

1. **Key decisions** — What was agreed upon?
2. **Action items** — Who is doing what, by when?
3. **Discussion summary** — Brief recap of each topic
4. **Open questions** — What was left unresolved?
5. **Follow-up** — Next meeting, items to prepare

### Step 4: Create the Meeting Note

Save as `Intelligence/meetings/[type]/YYYY-MM-DD Meeting Title.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: meeting
subtype: team-standup | client-call | one-on-one | board-review | all-hands | cross-team | general | personal
date: YYYY-MM-DD
time: HH:MM
participants: [[[Person A]], [[Person B]]]
duration: X minutes
source: manual | fireflies
status: processed
---
```

Body structure (uses Obsidian callouts for visual structure):

```markdown
# Meeting: [Title] — YYYY-MM-DD

## Participants
- [[Person A]]
- [[Person B]]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

> [!important] Key Decisions
> - [Decision 1]
> - [Decision 2]

> [!todo] Action Items
> - [ ] [[Person A]] — [Task] (by [date])
> - [ ] [[Person B]] — [Task] (by [date])

## Discussion Notes
### [Topic 1]
[Summary of discussion]

> [!question] Open Questions
> - [Unresolved item 1]

> [!info] Follow-up
> - Next meeting: [date/time if mentioned]
> - Prepare: [items to prepare]
```

Use `[[wikilinks]]` for participants and project references — this creates automatic backlinks in Obsidian.

**Business mode additions:**
- For board reviews: add `> [!warning] Governance Items` callout for board-level decisions
- For all-hands: add `> [!info] Company Announcements` callout
- For cross-team: add `> [!todo] Department Dependencies` callout with cross-team action items
- Link to relevant `[[Departments]]` when applicable

### Step 5: Create Tasks from Action Items

Automatically create a task for each action item using the TaskNotes API (see [Task Management](#task-management)). Tag with `["meeting"]`. If the API is unavailable, skip silently — action items are already in the meeting note.

### Step 6: Link to Projects

If the meeting relates to a known project (check `Projects/*/README.md`):
- Add `project: [Project Name]` to frontmatter
- Add a [[wiki link]] to the project in the meeting note

Business mode: also check `Departments/*/README.md` and add `department:` to frontmatter if applicable.

### Fireflies Sync

**MCP Server (Business Plan):** Check `.claude/settings.json` for a `fireflies` entry under `mcpServers`. If configured, use `fireflies_list_transcripts` and `fireflies_get_transcript` to sync unprocessed transcripts. Process each through Steps 1-6.

**Manual Export (Free Plan):** Have user export from app.fireflies.ai (Download > JSON or DOCX), paste content or drop file. Process through Steps 1-6.

**Claude Connector:** Users with Claude Pro/Max and Fireflies Business can connect via Claude Settings > Connectors.

### Querying Past Meetings

```bash
# Obsidian CLI (preferred)
obsidian search query="Person Name" limit=10

# Fallback: grep
grep -rl "Person Name" Intelligence/meetings/
```

Query by frontmatter: `participants`, `project`, `department`, `date`, `subtype`, `source`.

### Meeting Guidelines
- Always ask for meeting type if not obvious from transcript
- In personal mode, default to "general" or "personal" — don't offer business meeting types
- Extract ALL action items — don't miss any
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` for participants and projects
- Use callouts for visual structure
- Tag all Fireflies-sourced notes with `source: fireflies` in frontmatter

---

## General Guidelines

- **Memory protocol**: Before responding, load the primary context file and `Projects/*/README.md`. After responding, route any new knowledge to the right vault file (see Preserve Knowledge routing table).
- **Obsidian CLI first**: Always try `obsidian` CLI commands before falling back to direct file access or HTTP APIs.
- **Wikilinks everywhere**: Every mention of a project, person, or vault note in ANY file MUST be a `[[wikilink]]`. This is what builds the Obsidian graph. Not just internal links — every reference: tasks, daily notes, session logs, meeting notes, decisions, context files. If it's a name that exists (or could exist) as a vault note, wrap it in `[[]]`.
- **Teaching loop**: When corrected, automatically save the correction as a permanent rule in `claude.md`. Don't ask — just save and report.
- **File paths**: All paths are relative to the Obsidian vault root (the working directory).
- **Daily notes**: `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` is the most-read memory file — always keep it current.
- **Auto-archive threshold**: Primary context file > 100 lines. Archive older entries. Never archive core identity or active preferences.
- **Task system**: Try Obsidian CLI → TaskNotes API (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) → skip. If unavailable, note it and continue without task data.
- **Mode awareness**: Always check the mode before routing info or selecting templates. Don't offer business features in personal mode or vice versa.

## Auto-Save Rule

**Never ask the user for permission to save.** When meaningful information comes up — learnings, preferences, project updates, corrections, action items — save it to the right vault file immediately. After saving, briefly report what was saved and where. The user should never have to say "yes, save that."

## Anti-Patterns

Do NOT:
- Ask "should I save this?" or "would you like me to remember that?" — just save it
- Write project names, people, or note references as plain text — ALWAYS use `[[wikilinks]]`
- Use `[markdown](links)` for internal vault notes — always use `[[wikilinks]]`
- Put a `# Title` heading that duplicates the filename — Obsidian shows the filename as title
- Create orphan notes — always link new notes from at least one existing note
- Read entire files when scanning many — use `grep` for frontmatter or `obsidian search`
- Update vault files on casual chat — only when there's something worth recording
- Create tasks as plain text in notes — use the TaskNotes API or Obsidian CLI so they're queryable
- Offer business-mode features (departments, SOPs, stakeholders) in personal mode
- Offer personal-mode features (areas, collections, habits) in business mode unless explicitly asked
