**Commands:** `/personal-os` (skill overview)

#### Vault Structure

```
claude.md               — Brain file (operating instructions)
Context/                — Who you are: me.md, business.md, strategy.md, team.md, brand.md
Projects/               — What you're working on: intelligently structured per project
Intelligence/           — What you know: meetings/, competitors/, market/, decisions/
Daily/                  — What happened: YYYY-MM-DD.md journals
Resources/              — Your library: prompts, frameworks, swipe files, templates
```

#### Onboarding

Two questions only:
1. "Tell me about yourself (and your business)" — accepts text, files, or skip
2. "What are you currently working on?" — accepts text, files, or skip

No follow-ups. Extracts what it can, builds the vault, reports what was created.

#### Auto-Save Behavior

The assistant never asks permission to save. When meaningful information comes up (learnings, preferences, corrections, project updates, action items), it saves to the right vault file immediately and reports what was saved. Corrections are automatically added as permanent rules in `claude.md`.

#### Context Files (Only Created When Relevant)

| File | Created When |
|------|-------------|
| `Context/me.md` | Always (identity, preferences) |
| `Context/strategy.md` | User mentions goals or vision |
| `Context/business.md` | User mentions company or products |
| `Context/team.md` | User mentions team members |
| `Context/brand.md` | User mentions voice, tone, or brand |

#### Project Intelligence

Projects are not flat README-only folders. The assistant intelligently structures each project based on its content:

- **Starts simple** — new project = just a `README.md`
- **Grows organically** — subdirs (`research/`, `specs/`, `drafts/`, `notes/`, `ideas/`) are created on the fly when content arrives
- **Routes info to the right file** — research goes to `research/{topic}.md`, specs to `specs/`, drafts to `drafts/` — not crammed into README
- **README stays the index** — overview, status, next steps, links to subdir contents
- **Completed projects** — moved to `Intelligence/archive/`

#### Resources (`Resources/`)

Personal library for swipe files, prompts, frameworks, templates, and reference material. Organized flat or lightly nested (e.g., `Resources/prompts/`, `Resources/frameworks/`).

#### Key Integrations

- **Obsidian CLI** — preferred for vault operations when Obsidian is running
- **TaskNotes API** — HTTP API on localhost:8080 for task CRUD
- **Fireflies MCP** — meeting transcript sync (Business Plan)
- **Obsidian Bases** — native database views, no plugins needed
- **Defuddle** — web content extraction (`defuddle parse <url> --md`)

## n8n Skill

### Configuration

Requires a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
N8N_API_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com
N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key
N8N_CREDENTIALS_TEMPLATE_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/workflow/template-id
```

The skill will automatically create this file if missing and prompt for values.

### Node Selection Priority

**ALWAYS prefer native n8n nodes over HTTP Request or Code nodes.**

| Priority | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| 1. Native node | A built-in n8n node exists for the service (Slack, Google Sheets, etc.) |
| 2. **AI Agent node** | For ANY AI/LLM task - ALWAYS prefer over HTTP Request to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs |
| 3. **Loop node (Split In Batches)** | For processing multiple items - ALWAYS prefer over Code node loops |
| 4. HTTP Request | Native has issues OR no node exists AND not an AI task |
| 5. Code node | Complex logic that can't be done with built-in nodes |

### Incremental Build-Test Process (MANDATORY)

**THE #1 RULE: Add ONE node -> Test entire workflow -> Repeat**

```
Add Node A -> Test -> Add Node B -> Test -> Add Node C -> Test -> Done
```

**NEVER add two or more nodes at once. ALWAYS test after each single node.**

### Key API Patterns

| Operation | Method | Endpoint |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Create | POST | `/api/v1/workflows` |
| Update | **PUT** | `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` |
| Activate | **POST** | `/api/v1/workflows/{id}/activate` |
| Execute | POST | `/webhook/{path}` |

### Expression Essentials

**Webhook data lives under `.body`:**
```
{{ $json.body.fieldName }}  <- Correct
{{ $json.fieldName }}       <- Wrong (won't work)
```

### Code Node Return Format

```javascript
return [{ json: { result: "value" } }];
```

### Testing After Each Node

```bash
# 1. Activate
curl -X POST "${N8N_API_URL}/api/v1/workflows/{id}/activate"

# 2. Execute
curl -X POST "${N8N_API_URL}/webhook/{path}" -d '{}'

# 3. Check status
curl "${N8N_API_URL}/api/v1/executions?limit=1" | jq '.data[0].status'
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using PATCH instead of PUT for updates
- Using PUT with `{active: true}` instead of `/activate` endpoint
- Building all nodes then testing (build incrementally!)
- Fetching all executions (always use `?limit=2`)
- Using placeholder/mock data instead of real values

## Video Skill

### Tool Selection

| Task | FFmpeg | Remotion |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Stitching** | Same codec, no effects | Transitions, overlays, programmatic |
| **Transitions** | Simple crossfades | Multiple types, custom timing |
| **Captions** | SRT burn-in | TikTok-style word highlighting |
| **Teasers** | Quick clips | Text overlays, branded elements |

### Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Examine videos with ffprobe
2. **Transcribe** - Get speech content for smart cuts
3. **Ask** - Clarify user intent
4. **Plan** - Propose edit approach
5. **QA Test** - Run automated tests before preview
6. **Preview** - Show to user after QA passes
7. **Iterate** - Refine based on feedback

### Key Rules

- **Always preview in Remotion Studio before rendering**
- Never render automatically - wait for user approval
- Use whisper.cpp (not Python whisper) for fast transcription

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always test after each node** - No exceptions
2. **Copy full node configs from template** - Not just credentials
3. **Use correct API methods** - PUT for update, POST for activate
4. **Limit execution queries** - Always `?limit=2`
5. **Report only after confirmed working** - Never "please test this"
6. **Never use mock data** - Ask for real values

## MCP Server Integration

If the n8n MCP server is available, prefer using MCP tools for:
- Node discovery: `search_nodes`, `get_node`
- Validation: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`
- Templates: `search_templates`, `get_template`

Fall back to REST API skills when MCP is unavailable.

## Shared Skills (`shared-skills/`)

All skills live in `shared-skills/` as the single source of truth. The department-to-skill mapping is defined in `.claude-plugin/skills-map.json`. Running `./sync-skills.sh` copies skills into each department's `plugins/*/skills/` folder.

**Never edit skills directly in `plugins/*/skills/`** — those are overwritten by sync.

### Editing workflow

1. Edit the skill in `shared-skills/<skill>/`
2. If adding a new skill or changing which departments get it, update `.claude-plugin/skills-map.json`
3. Run `./sync-skills.sh`

### Before every push

Always run these before pushing:
```bash
./sync-skills.sh
```
This ensures `plugins/*/skills/` is in sync with `shared-skills/` and `.claude-plugin/skills-map.json`.

## Building Distributable Zips

Run `./build-zips.sh` to generate downloadable zip files in `dist/`. The script automatically runs `sync-skills.sh` first, then reads `marketplace.json`, detects all department plugins, and creates one zip per department plus a full marketplace zip.
